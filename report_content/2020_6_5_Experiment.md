Main experimental contents and conclusions of this week (China time: 2020.6.5, Friday) :

1. On the basis of the original setting of multi-level privacy, set the privacy level of all the 20 DCs to be one. Based on NewPregel model, the test graphs are power-law graph and NetWork graph, and the sampling probability formula was P=|1/last_change| and P=|1/(rank-0.15)|. PageRank and SSSP algorithm were run. The average relative error, wan usage, and performance of the results are checked based on this setting. 

      The experimental results are as follows: under the power-law graph, the average relative errors of all vertices of PageRank and SSSP are about 22% and 25% respectively;The number of iterations is 20 and 57 respectively. Under the network test graph, the average relative errors of all the vertices of PageRank and SSSP are about 9% and 28% respectively;The number of iterations is 20 and 33, respectively
